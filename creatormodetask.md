# Creator Mode Task Description

## Overview

This project is an **agentic AI extension** for VSCode, forked from **RooCode**, which itself is a fork of **Cline**. Our fork is called **PearAI-Roo-Code**.

## Goal

We are implementing a **new view called Creator Mode** into this extension. The objective is to introduce a **separate GUI file structure** to minimize merge conflicts when pulling upstream. However, separation is not a strict requirement—if it makes more sense to integrate changes within the existing structure, we will do so.

## Guidelines

- **Maintain Separation:** GUI files should be kept separate to minimize merge conflicts when pulling upstream.
- **Flexible Code Organization:** While separation is preferred, prioritize maintainability and efficiency over strict separation.
- **Keep This Document Updated:** Ensure this file always reflects the latest task status for continuity.
- **Clear and Concise Development:** No unnecessary complexity—keep solutions to the point and functional.
- no bs.
- dont hallucinate.

## Creator Mode Details

- Creator Mode will feature a **text input box** at the center, allowing users to enter prompts.
- The design will differ from the existing **ChatView** (`chatview.tsx`), but function similarly in terms of input handling.
- When the user enters a prompt, it will be sent to the **selected AI model**.
- The response will generate a **new file containing an action plan**, which the user can edit directly.
- A new **mode identifier** (`Creator Mode`) will be introduced, similar to the existing **Ask Mode** and **Architect Mode**.

## Development Plan (Step-by-Step)

[COMPLETED] - add completed tasks here

[NEXT STEPS]

1. **Initial Input Box Implementation**

    - Create a simple input box that sends user input to the selected model.
    - Ensure basic communication between the UI and backend.
    - Validate that the model receives and processes input correctly.

2. **Introduce Creator Mode**

    - Understand how existing "ask" mode and "architect" mode are implemented.
    - Add `Creator Mode` to the list of available modes.
    - Ensure the UI adapts accordingly when this mode is selected.

3. **Implement File Edit Functionality**
    - Modify the response handling to generate an editable file.
    - Provide a smooth user experience for modifying action plans.

- Proceed step-by-step, ensuring each milestone is functional before progressing, so begin with step **1: Implementing the input box** and verifying AI model communication, once stable, move on to **step 2: introducing Creator Mode**.

This file should be regularly updated to reflect the project's current state and objectives.
